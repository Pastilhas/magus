# MAGUS

[![Built][BuiltBadge]][BuiltUrl]

Magus is my personal site developed in [Vlang](https://vlang.io). This project works as my intro to Vlang,
and I have many many features planned for it. My objective is to create a proof of concept for different
projects, to show it is possible to create efficient, performant, and flexible code.

Some of the projects include:

1. introduction page
    - self presentation
    - education / experience
    - projects
2. music player
    - play random songs
    - play playlists
    - discover new songs
    - follow artists
3. blog
    - weekly updates about stuff
    - tech, software, cats
    - show personal interests
4. food
    - shopping list
    - recipies
